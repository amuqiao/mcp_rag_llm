Regarded as a genius in his youth, his exceptional progress set him apart from other family members and elevated his status within the family hierarchy. However, Xiao Yan experienced a sudden and unexplained decline in his battle power, which led to a significant loss of status. This deterioration not only stripped him of his former glory but also brought shame upon the Xiao Family in the eyes of its members, resulting in his fall from grace. Despite his earlier prominence, he is now viewed with disappointment by many within the family, underscoring the stark contrast between his past brilliance and current standing.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1765993647, "model": "qwen-plus", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 164, "prompt_tokens": 237, "total_tokens": 401, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
