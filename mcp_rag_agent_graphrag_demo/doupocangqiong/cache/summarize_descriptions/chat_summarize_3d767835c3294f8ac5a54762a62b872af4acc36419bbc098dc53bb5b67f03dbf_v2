Her strong performance earned her significant recognition, admiration, and high status within the family, standing in stark contrast to the humiliation endured by Xiao Yan, who failed to manifest notable battle power at the time. As a result, Xiao Mei's success not only elevated her standing but also subtly altered her relationship with Xiao Yan, reflecting a shift in familial dynamics. Additionally, she exhibits jealousy toward Xiao Xun'er, another prominent figure in the clan, particularly regarding Xun'er's superior beauty, talent, and esteemed status. This envy highlights Xiao Mei's awareness of hierarchy and competition within the Xiao family, underscoring her pride in her own accomplishments while revealing her insecurities in comparison to others.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1765993642, "model": "qwen-plus", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 184, "prompt_tokens": 248, "total_tokens": 432, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
