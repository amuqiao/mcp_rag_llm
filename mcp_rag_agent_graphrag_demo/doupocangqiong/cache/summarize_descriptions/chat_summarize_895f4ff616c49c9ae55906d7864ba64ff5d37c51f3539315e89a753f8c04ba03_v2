However, over the past three years, he mysteriously lost his cultivation abilities and regressed to possessing only three segments of battle power, leading to a dramatic fall from grace. Once revered as a gifted genius, Xiao Yan is now widely mocked and regarded with disappointment by his peers and the broader community, leaving him filled with bitterness, self-doubt, and a deep sense of lost dignity. Despite his current state, he is still remembered with pity and nostalgia by those who knew his former brilliance, such as Xiao Mei, and continues to be respected by Xiao Xun'er, who sees beyond his diminished abilities. Internally, Xiao Yan struggles with self-deprecating thoughts and dispirited reflection on his lost glory, embodying the complex emotional journey of a fallen genius seeking redemption.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1765993642, "model": "qwen-plus", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 212, "prompt_tokens": 301, "total_tokens": 513, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
